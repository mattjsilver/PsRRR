PROCEDURE FOR MAPPING SNPS TO PATHWAY MAPPING

1. REQUIRED SOURCE FILES

i. pathway or gene set file

White space delimited file.  Each line starts with pathway name, followed by a list of
genes mapping to that pathway (see data/genePathways.map for example).

ii. gene position file

Comma delimited (csv) file, with the following header:

Gene Start (bp), Gene End (bp), Chromosome Name, HGNC symbol,

(See genePos_GRCh37p3.csv for example.  This was downloaded from www.biomart.org).

** Note, gene locations must correspond to genome build of genotype file, to ensure that 
SNP/gene coordinates are aligned.  Also gene symbols must follow same convention as pathway
or gene set file (e.g. use HGNC gene symbols) **

iii. genotype files in PLINK bed/bim/fam format (see http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/)



2. RUNNING THE CODE

i. ensure that the program directory structure is as described in README.txt

ii. the program requires a paramater file containing file locations, program parameters
etc.  This must be located in the params directory.  The name of the params file must be
passed as an argument to program.  E.g. to run SNP to pathway mapping using the test data
provided, do the following:

	a. cd to the src/preprocessData/ directory
	b. type the following command at the prompt
		
		~/src/preprocessData> python mapSNPsToPathways.py PsRRR_params_test

To use your own data, amend the parameter file accordingly, and save it to a different name.
Then run the program with the new param file name as the sole argument.

iii. all files generated during the pathway mapping process will appear in the output 
directory specified in the params file.

iv. look carefully for any errors or warnings in the pathway mapping log file (see below).



3. OUTPUT FILES with test data provided (should be found in ~/sample_output/pathwayMapping
after running mapSNPsToPathways.py as directed above).

('sample' will be replaced by PLINK filename when running with user data)

sample_pathwayMapping.log	- log file detailing SNP to pathway mapping process 

sample_dataFile.pickle		- pickled file containing all genotype and pathway mapping data
							  required for PsRRR analysis (expanded and unexpanded genotype
							  minor allele count matrices (X, eX);  SNP to pathway mappings 
							  and information to trace SNPs and pathways back to their rsIDs, 
							  pathway names etc
sample_geneSNPs.pickle		- pre and post pathway mapping gene -> SNP and SNP -> gene maps, plus
							  other information relevant to snp <-> gene mapping process
sample_genotypes.pickle		- expanded and unexpanded genotype matrices, plus SNP idx to 
							  SNP RSid mappings
sample_pathwayMapping.pickle 			- detailed info on pathways <-> SNP mapping process

sample_unfilteredPathwayGenes.pickle 	- pathway -> gene and gene -> pathway maps, pre-SNP ->
										  pathway mapping, i.e. including genes and pathways
										  that may not map to SNPs in dataset

sample_mappedSNPs.txt		- textfile list of SNPs that map to pathways

sample_pathways_SNP_mapping.txt			-  text file of pathway -> SNP RSid mappings

PLINK files - recoded to minor allele counts:
sample_mappedSNPsOnly_recoded.log
sample_mappedSNPsOnly_recoded.nosex
sample_mappedSNPsOnly_recoded.raw

PLINK files corresponding to mapped SNPs only:
sample_mappedSNPsOnly.bed
sample_mappedSNPsOnly.bim
sample_mappedSNPsOnly.fam
sample_mappedSNPsOnly.log
sample_mappedSNPsOnly.nosex

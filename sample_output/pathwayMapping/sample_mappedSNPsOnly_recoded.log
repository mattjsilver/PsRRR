Reading pedigree information from [ /home/silverm/PsRRR/public/sample_output/pathwayMapping/sample_mappedSNPsOnly.fam ] 
400 individuals read from [ /home/silverm/PsRRR/public/sample_output/pathwayMapping/sample_mappedSNPsOnly.fam ] 
0 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
0 cases, 0 controls and 400 missing
0 males, 0 females, and 400 of unspecified sex
Warning, found 400 individuals with ambiguous sex codes

Reading genotype bitfile from [ /home/silverm/PsRRR/public/sample_output/pathwayMapping/sample_mappedSNPsOnly.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 536 SNPs
400 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 536 SNPs
After filtering, 0 cases, 0 controls and 400 missing
After filtering, 0 males, 0 females, and 400 of unspecified sex
